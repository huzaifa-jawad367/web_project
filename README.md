# Finding Kidnapped Children

## About the problem

Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world with a huge population of young people
and children. However it also lacks the resources to provide security for these children, or a
good environment for them to grow as a contributing member of society. There are many cases
of missing children in Pakistan each year, and the state and society as a whole lacks the
capability to even keep track of these cases, much less combat to reduce them. These cases
can include both runaways and kidnapped children. Many of these cases can go unreported
each year.
According to a report by the non-governmental organization Sahil, 2,960 cases of missing
children were reported in Pakistan in 2020. Of these, 1,659 were girls and 1,301 were boys.
Some studies have attempted to estimate the extent of underreporting in missing children
cases. For example, a study by the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC)
found that the number of missing children reported to law enforcement in Pakistan was only a
fraction of the estimated number of children who go missing each year. The study estimated
that 18,000 children go missing in Pakistan every year, while only around 2,000 cases are
reported to law enforcement. The two main causes of this underreporting is lack of trust of the people in the justice system and the law enforcement. Furthermore, there is also a social
stigma in case the child is suspected of running away.

## Our Solution

Our web application seeks to find a solution for these problems and empower the parents and
others in the society to track down and save the children that go missing each year; anyone can
be a volunteer and ensure that the lack of resources of law enforcement is not a problem. With
our web application we want to make it easy to report any cases and ensure their privacy at the
same time so parents don't have to worry about the social stigma that may come from their
children running away.
