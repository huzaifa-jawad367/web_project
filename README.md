# Finding Kidnapped Children

## About the problem

Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world with a huge population of young people
and children. However it also lacks the resources to provide security for these children, or a
good environment for them to grow as a contributing member of society. There are many cases
of missing children in Pakistan each year, and the state and society as a whole lacks the
capability to even keep track of these cases, much less combat to reduce them. These cases
can include both runaways and kidnapped children. Many of these cases can go unreported
each year.
According to a report by the non-governmental organization Sahil, 2,960 cases of missing
children were reported in Pakistan in 2020. Of these, 1,659 were girls and 1,301 were boys.
Some studies have attempted to estimate the extent of underreporting in missing children
cases. For example, a study by the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC)
found that the number of missing children reported to law enforcement in Pakistan was only a
fraction of the estimated number of children who go missing each year. The study estimated
that 18,000 children go missing in Pakistan every year, while only around 2,000 cases are
reported to law enforcement. The two main causes of this underreporting is lack of trust of the people in the justice system and the law enforcement. Furthermore, there is also a social
stigma in case the child is suspected of running away.

## Our Solution

Our web application seeks to find a solution for these problems and empower the parents and
others in the society to track down and save the children that go missing each year; anyone can
be a volunteer and ensure that the lack of resources of law enforcement is not a problem. With
our web application we want to make it easy to report any cases and ensure their privacy at the
same time so parents don't have to worry about the social stigma that may come from their
children running away.

## Future Stuff to Work on

### Advanced Features

**Geolocation and Last Seen Updates**

Implement a feature where parents can mark the last known location of their child on a map. Additionally, allow users to report sightings and provide geolocation data, helping to create a heat map of potential sightings.

**Real-Time Notifications and Alerts**

Set up a system to send real-time notifications to parents and local authorities when a potential match is found. This can include SMS, email alerts, or app notifications.

**Multilingual Support**

Add support for multiple languages to make the app accessible to a broader audience, especially in regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds.

**AI-Powered Age Progression**

Incorporate AI models that can predict and generate age-progressed images of missing children, helping to account for changes in appearance over time.

**Integration with Social Media**

Allow parents to share missing child reports directly on social media platforms to increase visibility and public awareness.

## Enhanced Security and Privacy

**Robust Authentication and Authorization**

Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for parent accounts and ensure secure data storage with encryption. Provide role-based access control to ensure sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.

**Data Anonymization**

Use techniques to anonymize data while maintaining the ability to perform accurate face matching. This ensures privacy while still allowing effective use of the system.

**Blockchain for Data Integrity**

Utilize blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and immutability of reported data, which can help in building trust and transparency in the system.

## Community and Collaboration Features

**Volunteer and Community Support Network**

Create a platform for volunteers to join the search efforts, providing a way for community members to get involved and assist in locating missing children.
